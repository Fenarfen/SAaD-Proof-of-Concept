# Database Initialisation

Follow this process to set up the database for this project:

1. If databse (AML) is not yet created run file 1 else skip
2. Run SQL in numbered file order to create tables. Order matters for defined relationships and constraints
3. If a table already exsits CREATE TABLE will fail. DROP any existing tables if the tables have been previously created before
